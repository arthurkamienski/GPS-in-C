# GPS-in-C
This is a GPS application written in C. The application reads a JSON file containing the description of the map, builds a graph based on it, finds the shortest route between two given points and gives the directions accordingly.

The map file used as input for the GPS can be either "ruas.json" (small map used for testing) or the map contained in .zip file (it is way bigger).
